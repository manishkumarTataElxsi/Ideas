To build software that can list all objects in an image, you'll need to work with **computer vision** and **object detection** techniques. Here's a roadmap to help you get started:

### **1. Choose a Framework or Library**
- **OpenCV**: Popular for image processing tasks.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Great for deep learning-based object detection.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Fast and efficient object detection model.
- **Detectron2**: Facebookâ€™s advanced object detection framework.

### **2. Select a Pre-trained Model**
If you're not building your own model from scratch, you can use a pre-trained one:
- **YOLOv8**
- **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)**
- **Faster R-CNN**
- **MobileNet-SSD** (for lightweight applications)

### **3. Load and Process the Image**
- Use **OpenCV** or **PIL (Python Imaging Library)** to read and preprocess the image.
- Convert to grayscale, resize, or normalize if required.

### **4. Object Detection**
- Use a deep learning model to detect objects.
- Run the image through the trained network to get bounding boxes and labels.

### **5. Extract and List Objects**
- Retrieve detected object names.
- Store them in a list, database, or display them on a UI.

### **6. Build a User Interface (Optional)**
- A simple GUI using **Tkinter**, **PyQt**, or **Web framework** for interaction.
- Web-based interface using **Flask** or **Django**.

### **7. Optimize and Deploy**
- If required, optimize the model for edge devices using TensorRT or OpenVINO.
- Deploy it as an API or an offline tool.
